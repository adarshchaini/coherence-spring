Oracle Coherence Spring Integration
===================================

**Version: ${project.version} built on ${timestamp}**

The Oracle Coherence Spring Integration project allows a Spring BeanFactory
to provide objects to a Coherence class-scheme. A class-scheme in a
Coherence configuration file is the means by which objects are made
avaliable to a Coherence scheme. The most common use of class-scheme
is to provide a Cache Store object for reading/writing to an external
data store.
