Getting Help
------------

There are many avenues to receive help when using the ${site-project-title}.
Here are a few options.

<h4>Community Forums</h4>

The Discussion Forums for the ${site-project-title} project are the best place
to start asking questions - should you need to.   These forums are hosted by
Oracle and are typically monitored by the community.

They can be found here: [https://community.oracle.com/community/fusion_middleware/coherence/coherence_support][FORUMS]

<h4>Source Code, Tests and Examples</h4>

As all of the source code, including tests and examples are now published, these
are often a great place to start for implementation tips.

The source code is located here:

<h4>Issue Tracking System</h4>

If you find an issue with the ${site-project-title} or have an idea for a new feature
the best place to start is with the Issue Tracking System.  All issues, both current and
past are publicly viewable.

The Issue Tracking System can be found here: [https://github.com/coherence-community/coherence-spring/issues][ISSUES]

<h4>Oracle Support</h4>

Alternatively Oracle Coherence customers can file Support Requests (SR) against the
Coherence Product, clearly specifying that requests are for a Coherence Community
project.
